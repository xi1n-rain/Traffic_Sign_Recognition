**Notice :** We did not utilize DL models for this project. 

+ Both the Starter and Expert levels require Dataset_1. The Bonus level requires Dataset_2. Make sure to update the paths in the code accordingly.
+ Refer to the poster for specific details. Feel free to execute the code, modify methods, adjust parameters, and observe performance variations.
+ Running the Bonus level code without a GPU may take less than 15 minutes.(It means that GPU is optional.)
