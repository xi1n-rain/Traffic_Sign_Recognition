# Traffic_Sign_Recognition

This project, for the ***Visual Computing*** track of the ***National University of Singapore School of Computing Summer Workshop 2023***, was completed with the contributions of *Yuhao Zhang*, *Bingyu Chen*, *Aijing Liu*, and *Yuxin Tan*. We successfully finished the project and were awarded the 3rd prize.

### 0. Downlaod Datasets, environment configuration
Before running code, you should download the datasets. Starter_level and expert_level need Dataset1. The bonus level needs Dataset2. 
Change path in the code.        
Also need to do environmental configuration. We highly reconmmend Anaconda.

### 1. Level-1: starter.py
```markdown
python starter.py
```
In this level, we have implemented a straightforward classification exercise. Simply run the code, and you will observe an accuracy of approximately 0.94.          
Running the code without a GPU may require less than 2 minutes.(This means that GPU is optional.)
