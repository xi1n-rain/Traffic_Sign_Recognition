# Traffic_Sign_Recognition 

This project was part of the ***Visual Computing*** track of the ***National University of Singapore, School of Computing(SoC) Summer Workshop 2023***. It's a collaborative effort among four group members. We were awarded the 3rd prize for this project.

**Notice :** We did not utilize DL models for this project. 

+ Both the Starter and Expert levels require Dataset_1. The Bonus level requires Dataset_2. Make sure to update the paths in the code accordingly. [Dataset_1](https://nlpr.ia.ac.cn/pal/trafficdata/recognition.html) | [Dataset_2](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)
+ Refer to the poster for specific details. Feel free to execute the code, modify methods, adjust parameters, and observe performance variations.
+ Running the Bonus level code without a GPU may take less than 15 minutes.(It means that GPU is optional.)
